### How to access the fragment-docking script

An example of the script syntax is as follows::

`usage: fragment_docking.py [-h] -i CONFIG_FILE`

where the arguments are:

```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  -i CONFIG_FILE  File containing all the necessary parameters to run the
                  protocol

 ```

In addition of the script, the folder require of the target PDB structure file, a folder with a set of necessary scripts, and an output folder where the docking results step by step will be stored.

```
[target].pdb output scripts
```
An example to run the protocol script using the structure provided in the docker folder `/home/docking` is here:

`
python fragment_docking.py -i input.txt"
`

The method will start the modelling of the initial script, and the docking of the fragment after each growing step, until the peptide obtain the final desired size. The code can be modified to modifiy box sizes, as well as verify if the conformation of the growing ligand is according to previous findings of the biological system. An example of the output docked result, and the configuration each docking step is available in the output\_1NTV folder as follows:

`final_complex1_NFDNPVYRKT.pdb final_complex2_NFDNPVYRKT.pdb final_complex3_NFDNPVYRKT.pdb step0  step1  step2	step3  step4`
